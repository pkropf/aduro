# aduro
Control system for flame effects or other systems controlling 120v circuits.

Aduro provides the ability to switch a series of 120 volt sockets on and off remotely. Timing is rather important as is reliability, having a flame effect trigger at an inappropriate time can have rather dire consequences. 

General features of the system:

  - master control panel
    - simple interface
      - series of on / off switches, slider potentiometers and rotary potentiometers
      - or a touch screen?
    - programmable sequences
    - wireless communication with control packs
    - secure communications
    - control packs are registered with the control panel
    - possibly controllable via iphone / ipad / android tablet
  - control packs
    - quad 120v circuits pack controlled through relays
    - quad relay pack with exposed connectors
    - control packs return to a known state when communication with the maser controller is lost
  - other thoughts
    - logging of all commands
